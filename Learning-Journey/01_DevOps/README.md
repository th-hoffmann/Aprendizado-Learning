# 🔧 DevOps Learning Path

## 📋 Overview
This section contains all my DevOps-related learning materials, certifications, and projects. DevOps represents the intersection of development and operations, focusing on automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and infrastructure management.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Gain expertise in containerization and orchestration
- Learn monitoring and observability practices
- Develop skills in configuration management

## 📁 Organization
